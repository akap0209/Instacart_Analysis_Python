## Objective
The project focused on Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they wanted to uncover more information about their sales patterns. I performed an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data to derive insights. The objective is to learn more about a variety of Instacart customers' purchasing habits to devise a targeted marketing strategy.
